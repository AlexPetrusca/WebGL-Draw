# WebGL-Draw

An application to draw generalized cylinder wireframes over a model polyline and render the wireframe objects with perspective projection and various types of shading/lighting models. Drawn objects can then be moved around via click and drag (alpha picking).

You can interact with the app using the following link: https://alexpetrusca.github.io/drawer
